# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A portfolio website collection of pre-recorded timelapses of nature. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
It will be a webpage that you'd be able to scroll through and watch timelapses that record the cloud movements as well
as other nature backgrounds. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be to have a website up and have uploaded at least one timelapse onto the website 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
the website has more than just one page, multiple timelapse entries, website has a theme 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best otucome would be that I have uploaded all the timelapses intended, the website has multiple pages, quotes, 
and a theme. Perhaps links leading to other sites that help with meditation. 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Currently, I have created the webpage following the Homepage track on canvas. My next step is to learn CSS basics to make the webpage more lively. I know how to upload pictures from my browser so I don't think this will be as big of a 
challenge.
